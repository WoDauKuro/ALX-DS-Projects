# Crop Yield Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

Simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to quantify the relationship between two variables. It allows us to predict an outcome (dependent variable) based on the value of one predictor (independent variable). In this challenge, we applied simple linear regression to understand how different environmental factors affect the standardized yield of crops. Our insights aim to help local farmers maximize their harvests and contribute to sustainable agriculture practices in Maji Ndogo.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to determine how pollution levels affect the standardized yield of various crop types. By understanding this relationship, we can provide valuable insights to farmers, aiding them in optimizing their crop yields and contributing to sustainable agriculture.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

We started by collecting a dataset containing information about different crop types and their standardized yields, along with pollution levels.

### Results

Based on the standard deviation of the residuals, **tea** appears to be the crop type most affected by pollution compared to other crop types. Conversely, **potato** appears to be the least affected by pollution.

## Conclusion

Our insights from the simple linear regression analysis provide valuable information to local farmers in Maji Ndogo. By understanding the effects of pollution on crop yields, farmers can make informed decisions to optimize their harvests. This not only helps in maximizing yields but also contributes to sustainable agriculture practices, benefiting both the farmers and the environment.
