# Image Classification Project

This project consists of four main parts: Extracting the data, Training the model, Testing the model, and Plotting the results.

## The Data

The dataset used in this project is called MNIST. MNIST is a large collection of hand-drawn digits ranging from 0 to 9. It is a commonly used dataset for learning image classification as it requires little to no preprocessing.

You can download the dataset from [The MNIST Database](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331130319/https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Make sure to download all four files. These files include the images and their respective labels. The dataset has already been split into a training set and a test set.

## Parts of the Project

1. **Extracting the Data:** This part involves downloading and preparing the MNIST dataset for training the model.

2. **Training the Model:** Here, the extracted data is used to train an image classification model. Various machine learning or deep learning algorithms can be applied.

3. **Testing the Model:** After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set to assess its accuracy and other metrics.

4. **Plotting the Results:** Finally, the results of the model's performance are visualized to see if our model has trained correctly.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. Additionally, you may need to install the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
